		<h2>The ways to earn the sophistication point on your essays:</h2>

		<h3>There are 4 ways to earn the point. These ways include:</h3>
		<div>
		<b>
			Alternate Interpretations- The alternative interpretation is taking the text and the way it is meant to be perceived and warping the 	authors words and phrases to twist the proposed perception and make it either the opposite or their own interpretation.<br><br>

			Complexion and tension in the passage- The complex feelings within the passage and undertones of tension that make the whole story 	better without the reader or audience realizing. These can be implied or direct but not usually a main focal point within the passage. <br><br>

			Illuminating the student's interpretation by situating it within a broader context- Take the students personal interpretation and widen it, like a reverse funnel in a way. Take a smaller point and grow it to be within the entire text and perhaps even out of the scope of the text with real-life examples or other texts. <br><br>

			A consistent vivid and persuasive writing style- Uses different literary elements and diction to indulge the reader in their writing and make the reader hooked deep within the text that they are writing.

		<u>ALTERNATE INTERPRETATION</u> <br><br>

		A Time to Talk (Robert Frost)- <br><br>

		“When a friend calls to me from the road <br>

		And slows his horse to a meaning walk, <br>

		I don’t stand still and look around <br>

		On all the hills I haven’t hoed, <br> 

		And shout from where I am, What is it? <br>

		No, not as there is a time to talk. <br>

		I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground, <br>

		Blade-end up and five feet tall, <br>

		And plod: I go up to the stone wall <br>
 
		For a friendly visit.” <br><br>

	
		Formal interpretation- They should not stand still and look around and start shouting down the hill, as this is not how we treat somebody that we care about. ❌ <br><br>

		Alternate interpretation- Work must be completed before play and friendly chatter. This is shown through his end of his work (“I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground”) (“I don’t stand still and look around”) and then going to talk to his friend (“I go up to the stone wall For a friendly visit”) (“No, not as there is a time to talk”) ✅</b>

			<br><br><u>BROADER CONTEXT</u><br><br>

			Victory (Sherman Alexie)<br><br>

			When I was twelve, I shoplifted a pair Of basketball shoes. We could not afford Them otherwise. But when I tied them on, I found that I couldn’t hit a shot. 

			When the ball clanked off the rim, I felt Only guilt, guilt, guilt. O, immoral shoes! O, kicks made of paranoia and rue! Distraught but unwilling to get caught

			Or confess, I threw those cursed Nikes Into the river and hoped that was good Enough for God. I played that season In supermarket tennis shoes that felt

			The same as playing in bare feet. O, torn skin! O, bloody heels and toes! O, twisted ankles! O, blisters the size Of dimes and quarters! Finally, after

			I couldn’t take the pain anymore, I told My father what I had done. He wasn’t angry. He wept out of shame. Then he cradled And rocked me and called me his Little

			Basketball Jesus. He told me that every cry Of pain was part of the hoops sonata. Then he laughed and bandaged my wounds— My Indian Boy Poverty Basketball Stigmata.<br><br>


			Personal student interpretation- Shoes don’t make you better, the practice and journey makes you better at basketball. ❌<br><br>

			Broadened interpretation- Your environment doesn’t make you any better, only you and your choices make you better, so make the right choices to determine your future. ✅

			<br><br><u>COMPLEXITIES AND TENSION</u><br><br>

			Dover Beach (Mathew Arnolde)<br><br>

			The sea is calm tonight.<br>

			The tide is full, the moon lies fair<br>

			Upon the straits; on the French coast the light<br>

			Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,<br>

			Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.<br>

			Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!<br>

			Only, from the long line of spray<br>

			Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,<br>

			Listen! you hear the grating roar<br>

			Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,<br>

			At their return, up the high strand,<br>

			Begin, and cease, and then again begin,<br>

			With tremulous cadence slow, and bring<br>

			The eternal note of sadness in.<br><br>


			Sophocles long ago<br>

			Heard it on the Ægean, and it brought<br>

			Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow<br>

			Of human misery; we<br>

			Find also in the sound a thought,<br>

			Hearing it by this distant northern sea.<br>


			The Sea of Faith<br>

			Was once, too, at the full, and round earth’s shore<br>

			Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.<br>

			But now I only hear<br>

			Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,<br>

			Retreating, to the breath<br>

			Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear<br>

			And naked shingles of the world.<br><br>


			Ah, love, let us be true<br>

			To one another! for the world, which seems<br>

			To lie before us like a land of dreams,<br>

			So various, so beautiful, so new,<br>

			Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,<br>

			Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;<br>

			And we are here as on a darkling plain<br>

			Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,<br>

			Where ignorant armies clash<br><br>

			General interpretation: This is about how love has two sides, one of roughness and one of joy and calmness.❌<br><br>

			Complex Interpritation- We see the passage start off slow and talk about how peaceful the ocean is. This is the quickly followed up with a sharp wave that changes the feel and adds a bit of tension when she starts comparing it to love. She then goes into her very complex feelings on love like how its up and down by using the ocean as the catalyst for these emotions. She feels love is such a truly hard thing to acquire but when things do settle its great. The tension is built by using the ocean which is expertly used to convey the many moving emotions they feel.✅
